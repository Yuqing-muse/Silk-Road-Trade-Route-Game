It is a strategic exploration game with a focus on trade simulation and free exploration. The game will use a fresh, low polygon art style to portray the customs and culture of the cities along the route. In the game, players will lead an ancient caravan of merchants from China to other cities along the trade route. In the cities of other countries, players will be able to explore the scenery and unique historical and cultural backgrounds of the cities and build up their wealth through trade activities. During the journey, players may also encounter a variety of strange encounters and unexpected events, and feel the joy of exploration. After fifty years of in-game time, the player's career as a merchant will come to a close. The artefacts you have collected are displayed in a gallery for you to admire and learn more about the cities you have visited, along with details of the local music and artworks.
